# NLP Requirement Extraction System using HuggingFace (Free & Offline)

This project is an **NLP-based Requirement Extraction System** built using **HuggingFace Transformers**, **Python**, and **Regex**.  
It analyzes customer messages/emails and automatically extracts:

- Intent (e.g., purchase request)
- Product name
- Brand
- Quantity
- Specifications (like RAM, processor, etc.)

This solves a real industry problem where companies want to extract structured information from unstructured customer text.
